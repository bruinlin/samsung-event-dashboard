# Changelog

## 1.0.0-web - 2026-07-22

- Prepared the existing Samsung Event Dashboard as a framework-free static website for GitHub and Cloudflare Pages.
- Preserved the existing visual design, responsive layout, workstream logic and OCTS 2026 data.
- Added the missing `assets` and `data` runtime files required by `index.html`.
- Added root-level `event_data.js` as the event registry used by the static deployment.
- Kept Supabase integration disabled; the release uses local JavaScript data only.
- Excluded local backups, legacy deployment helpers, generated SQL and secrets from Git.
- Fixed narrow-screen containment so the workstream table scrolls inside its panel instead of widening the page.
